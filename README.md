# Gradebook

Can either read in a gradebook from either text or binary files or create one on runtime

Once opened, the user can:

    -Swap which gradebook is opened
    -Add names/grades to the gradebook
    -Lookup specific score for a student's name
    -Remove names/grades from the gradebook
    -Print the gradebook to the console (formatted in a user-readable way)
    -Save the gradebook to either a text or binary file

The gradebook is stored in a binary tree in alphabetical order based on the names

The gradebook also dynamically allocates/frees memory
